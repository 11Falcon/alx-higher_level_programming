>>> BaseGeometry = __import__("7-base_geometry").BaseGeometry

NOw let's start tesing 

>>> basegeometry = BaseGeometry()

>>> basegeometry.area()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
Exception: area() is not implemented
>>> basegeometry.integer_validator("my_int", 12)

>>> basegeometry.integer_validator("name", "john")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: name must be an integer

>>> basegeometry.integer_validator("distance", -4)
