# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Overview
This project delves into the fundamental concept that in Python, everything is an object. The focus is on understanding Python's handling of different types of objects, particularly the distinctions between immutable and mutable objects.

## Background Context
This project encourages a closer examination of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, emphasizing the understanding that everything in Python is an object. The scenarios presented, such as variable modification and object aliasing, prompt contemplation about Python's behavior with different object types.

## Project Structure
1. **Questions:** The first part of the project comprises questions about Python's specificity, challenging participants to predict outcomes before testing in the interpreter. The emphasis is on understanding the reasons behind the answers.

2. **Approach:** Participants are advised to refrain from immediate coding in the Python interpreter. Instead, they are encouraged to read documentation, think, and brainstorm with peers before validating their insights through testing.

## Resources
Participants are recommended to read or watch the following:

- [Objects and values](#)
- [Aliasing](#)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](#)
- [Mutation (Only this chapter)](#)
- [Cloning lists](#)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](#)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to articulate, without relying on external resources:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is an object
- The difference between a class and an object or instance
- The difference between immutable and mutable objects
- The concept of reference in Python
- What an assignment is
- Understanding aliasing in Python
- Identifying if two variables are identical
- Determining if two variables are linked to the same object
- Displaying variable identifiers (memory address in CPython)
- Grasping the concepts of mutable and immutable objects
- Recognition of built-in mutable and immutable types
- Understanding how Python passes variables to functions

## Project Methodology
1. **Read Documentation:** Participants are advised to thoroughly read the provided resources to build a strong foundation.

2. **Thinking and Brainstorming:** Before writing any code, participants should spend time thinking and brainstorming with peers to develop a conceptual understanding.

3. **Answering Questions:** Responses to project questions should be concise, one-liners, reflecting a deep understanding of Python's behavior.

4. **Reflection:** The project aims to equip participants with the ability to apply learned logic to different variables and variable types, preparing them for Python interviews.

## Note
Understanding the reasons behind the answers to Python specificity questions is crucial for applying the same logic to various scenarios. This project provides valuable insights for Python programming interviews.
